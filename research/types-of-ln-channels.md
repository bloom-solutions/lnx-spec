- Normal
  - sats only
  - create your own channels, manage liquidity
- Hosted
  - Someone manages channels for you or you share channels with others
  - Shared liquidity
  - Two types
    1. Fully custodial
      - Entry in their database
    2. Mostly custodial
      - 100% compatible with lightning channels
      - You build your own invoices
      - Cryptographically secure: you can't be lied to by the host
      - Only thing custodian can do is run away with your funds but they can't lie to you
- Self-custodial
  - Your own node, whether on phone or device at home
  - You manage your channels, your liquidity
- Hedged
  - Can only be applied to hosted channels
  - Host essentially buys the fiat currency when you receive bitcoin, sells the fiat currency when you sent bitcoin
- Stabilized
  - Only makes sense to do so in self-custodial
  - Sats in the channel:
    - increases when the asset value it represents goes down in value vs bitcoin
    - decreases when the asset value it represents goes up in value vs bitcoin
