# lnx-spec

LNX ("links") is a set of standards and open source software which people/institutions (such as exchanges) can use to integrate with the Bitcoin and Lightning Network (LN). Its goal is to lower the barrier to entry for development teams for such integrations.

The level of integration is flexible: you may want to manage your own treasury, or you may want to just use LNX standards as a way to talk to other Bitcoin exchanges which will take care of that for you. An example of this is for a bank that wants to offer Bitcoin deposits over LN. They may not be ready to custody Bitcoin and run a Lightning node, and simply want to get their local fiat currency for Bitcoin sent over, or to get Bitcoin for fiat they are selling.
